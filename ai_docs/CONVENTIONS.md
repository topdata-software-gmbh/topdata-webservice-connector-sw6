# PHP code style conventions

- the names of a private method should start with an underscore, e.g. `_myPrivateMethod()`
- each class should have a docblock explaining what the class does
- each method should have a docblock explaining what the method does, except setters and getters
- Do NOT add redundant PHPDoc tags to docblocks, e.g. `@return void` or `@param string $foo` without any additional information
- the signature of a method should have type hints for all parameters and the return type
